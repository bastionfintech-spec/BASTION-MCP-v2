However, this move is heavily catalyst-driven by SEC settlement rumors, and news-driven rallies carry binary event risk. Moving to breakeven at $2.40 protects against a sudden reversal if the rumor is denied while allowing the trade to capture further upside. The $0.18 buffer between the retest HL and entry is reasonable for XRP's volatility profile.\"}"}]}
