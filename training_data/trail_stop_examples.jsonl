With Solana DeFi TVL surging past $8B and Phantom wallet users at ATH, the ecosystem fundamentals support continued appreciation. However, the $170 supply zone could trigger a pullback, so the slightly tighter 1.8x ATR multiplier is appropriate to protect profit near the resistance cluster. The trail at $164 locks in over +1R while giving $4 of room below current price.\"}"}]}
